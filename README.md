# Supplementary Material

This Github repository contains the data, analysis code, and results for the paper by Veillard & Vincent (in preparation).

Core analysis files to look at:
- `supplementary_analysis.html` contains the majority of the supplementary results. This is produced by the R code in `supplementary_analysis.Rmd`.
- `evaluate the rate hypothesis.ipynb` This Jupyter notebook contains Python code to analyse our hypothesis that discount rates moderate the rate of BMI gain with age.
- `bayesian meta analysis MCQ.ipynb` and `bayesian meta analysis WCQ.ipynb` are also Jupyter notebooks containing Python code. These run the Bayesian meta analyses.

Other files of interest:
- the `jasp/` folder contains the [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org) files for some of the data analyses.
- `metaBayes` is a Python package which implements Bayesian meta analysis. In the future this may be expanded and released as a stand-alone Python package.
